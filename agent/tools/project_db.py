"""Read-only SQL access to a project's own application database.

Why this exists as a host-side tool rather than just letting the agent run
`psql`/Prisma inside its sandbox: the sandbox container is on Docker's
default bridge, so `localhost` there is the container itself and the host's
Postgres is simply unreachable. Opening that up (`--network host`, or a
host-gateway route) would hand an agent-controlled container every
host-local service -- including the review service's control port, which is
unauthenticated precisely because "localhost only" was assumed to be the
boundary. This tool gives the agent the one capability it actually needed
-- "does this product exist, and what does its row look like" -- without
moving that boundary at all.

Found necessary 2026-08-24: a task asked to replace one product's hero
image searched the codebase, the seeds, the migrations and all 242 commits
for the product, found nothing, and stopped to ask the operator. It was
right that the product isn't in the code -- it's a catalog row in Postgres,
which the agent had no way to look at.

Safety, in layers, so no single one has to be perfect:
  1. Only SELECT/WITH statements are accepted, and only one per call.
  2. The query runs inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY` -- Postgres itself
     rejects any write, so this holds even if the check above is somehow
     talked past. That is the real guarantee; (1) exists to give a clear
     error rather than a confusing permission failure.
  3. A statement timeout, so a pathological query can't pin a connection.
  4. A hard row cap, so a `SELECT *` on a big table can't blow up the
     context window.
  5. The connection targets exactly the DSN configured for that one project.
     A Postgres connection reaches a single database, so this cannot read
     another project's data or the agent's own tables regardless of what
     the SQL says.

The DSN is read from the project's own live `.env` at call time rather than
copied into this agent's config -- one source of truth, and no second place
for a database credential to sit and go stale.
